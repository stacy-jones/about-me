  <p>Hi! My name is Stacy Jones. I am New Orleans native that lkoves toi cook, travel and spread positivity. 
    In 2005 I started a company, Petit Tours, that provides local sightseeing excursions to
   tourists and locals visiting the city. I am also an educator with the belief that children
    thrive in environments that are catered to their strengths and interests. 
   Recently, I have decided to become a software developer. My first big assignment is to create a guessing game. I'm excited to have you learn some fun facts about me. Let's play!
