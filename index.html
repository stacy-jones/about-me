  <p>Hi! My name is Stacy Jones. I am New Orleans native that loves to spread positivity. In 2015, I started a company, Petit Tours, that provides local sightseeing excursions to tourists and locals in the city. I am also an educator that ensures children thrive in environments that are catered to their strengths and interests. Recently, I have decided to become a software developer. I plan to use my coding skills to introduce little ones to the world of technology!
