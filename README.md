### Reflections and Comments

* How do you see yourself planning and evaluating your learning? 
I am finding that I am able to create a basic website. This is something that I once thought would be too difficult. I know now that it takes time and dedication, but I will successfully complete the assignments. Each one is challenging me to push myself further along.
What details will you record and/or measure? 
I have the notes from class written in a notebook and I look to them constantly for guidance.
How often will you evaluate what you want to learn?
Each time that I am able to figure a problem out and not look into my notebook, I am happy. I am commiting more of the website building process to memory and that has helped me to finish my labs quicker.
